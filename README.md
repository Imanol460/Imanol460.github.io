My Github account was created for this assigment as I have never had one before. I would say that it is pretty bare bone with nothing much on it as of now.
The repository that I created was the first one I have never created. It has my name on it to make it easier for me to find 
Cloning the repository was actually easier then I thought. One just selects the choice to "clone a respository" after choosing the one you want to clone. It asks where on your local device that you want the file to be added. I created a new folder to help keep myself organized.
